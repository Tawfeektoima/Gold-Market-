# Gold Price Analysis: Egypt vs USA (1979‚Äì2023)

## Overview
This project investigates gold price trends across multiple countries from **1979 to 2023**. The main focus is on **Egypt** and the **United States**, aiming to understand:

- The **seasonality of buying and selling gold in Egypt**
- The **correlation between the Egyptian and U.S. gold markets**

To ensure accurate comparison, we removed all other countries from the original dataset and included an additional dataset for the **EGP to USD exchange rate**. This allowed us to normalize Egyptian gold prices to USD values.

## Key Findings

- A **strong correlation** was observed between gold prices in Egypt and the United States.
- Major global events had clear impacts on both markets:
  - **9/11 Attacks (2001)**
  - **Global Financial Crisis (2008)**
  - **Oil oversupply in 2015** during U.S.‚ÄìRussia competition
  -  **COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)**
- U.S. gold prices were consistently **slightly higher** than in Egypt after conversion, though both markets followed **very similar trends**.

##  Data Sources

- Historical gold prices dataset (1979‚Äì2023) across multiple countries
- USD/EGP exchange rate dataset (for currency conversion)

##  Conclusion

The results confirm a **strong linkage** between Egypt‚Äôs gold market and the U.S. gold market. Despite differences in local economics and currency, **Egyptian gold prices closely mirror U.S. price trends**. This project also identifies clear **seasonal cycles** in gold buying and selling behaviors within Egypt, which could be valuable for investors and analysts.

## Future Work

- Use time series models (ARIMA, LSTM) to forecast future prices
- Extend comparison to include other regional gold markets
- Analyze the impact of local economic policies in Egypt on gold prices
